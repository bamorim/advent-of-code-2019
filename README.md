# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains the solutions for Advent of Code 2019.
I'm solving this in 2021 though, but I'm using the problems as a way to force me to learn Go.

I'm pretty new to Go, so beware that code here is probably far from ideal.

## Template

```go
package dayN

import "fmt"

// Run runs day N
func Run(bytes []byte) {
	fmt.Printf("Day N - Part 1: ")
	fmt.Println("NOT IMPLEMENTED")

	fmt.Printf("Day N - Part 2: ")
	fmt.Println("NOT IMPLEMENTED")
}
```
